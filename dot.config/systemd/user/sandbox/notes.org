* Problem
  It's good to start emacs and google-chrome within systemd. The only problem is they
  cannot use fcitx.

  I tried checking fcitx is started before start emacs. It apparently doesn't help.

  It seems that if started within systemd, emacs or google-chrome don't aware of fcitx's
  existence. Or fcitx doesn't know emacs/google-chrome is started?

  How to make fcitx and systemd services known to each other?

  Tried dbus-launch in emacs.service. Not working.
  
* Dependency tree
  Dependencies are typically placed on services and not on targets. For example,
  network.target is pulled in by whatever service configures your network interfaces,
  therefore ordering your custom unit after it is sufficient since network.target is
  started anyway. [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd]
